# Air_hockey 

This repository contains the complete code for the data collection framework dubbed "Air Hockey". This framework consists of two KUKA IIWA robots hitting an object back and forth between each other's workspace. The hit object slides on a surface, leaving the hitting robot's workspace to end up in the receiving robot's workspace. The roles are then reversed and the object is hit back in the opposite direction. This setup allows for fast data collection on hitting objects, sliding and impact.
